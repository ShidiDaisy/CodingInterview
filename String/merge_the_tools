# We can split a string s into n/k subsegments where each subsegment, t, consists of a contiguous block of k characters in s. Then, use each t
# to create string u such that:
#
# The characters in u are a subsequence of the characters in t.
# Any repeat occurrence of a character is removed from the string such that each character in u occurs exactly once.

            if c not in sub:
                sub += c;
