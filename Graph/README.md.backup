 	* A minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree of connected, undirected graph. It connects all vertices together with minimal total weighting for its edges.
 	* The minimum spanning tree of this graph

 5. [Dijkstra's Algorithm] (https://www.techiedelight.com/single-source-shortest-paths-dijkstras-algorithm/)
 	* Single Source Shortest Paths
 	* Given a source vertex s in a weighted graph where all its edges are non-negative, find the shortest-path weights d(s,v) from s to every vertices v in the graph
 	* For example, path from vertex A to B has min cost of 4 and the route is A->E->B
