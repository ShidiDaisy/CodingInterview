  2. [Preorder Tree Traversal](https://www.techiedelight.com/preorder-tree-traversal-iterative-recursive/)
	* Start from root
	* The traversal can be done iteratively where the deferred nodes are sorted in the stack or it can be done through recursion.

3. [Postorder Tree Traversal](https://www.techiedelight.com/postorder-tree-traversal-iterative-recursive/)
	* Start from leaf, recursively traverse its' left subtree then it's right subtree.
	* Root will be the last node to visit.

## Sort
### Topological Sort
A topological sort of a directed graph is a linear order of its vertices such that for every directed edge uv from  vertex u to v. A topological sort is possible if and only if the graph is DAG.
